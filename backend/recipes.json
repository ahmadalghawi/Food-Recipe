With the mixer still on low, add the hot water in a slow stream, then turn the mixer to medium and beat until smooth, about 2 minutes. The batter will be very thin. \r\nPour into prepared cake pans no more than 2/3 full and bake for 32-36 minutes, until a toothpick inserted comes out clean.

    "instructions": "Heat butter and olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Sauté onions for 3 minutes or until translucent, add garlic and chicken livers. Sauté until chicken livers are browned, then add red peppers and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Stir, add tomato paste, Worcestershire sauce, seasonings, oregano, bay leaves and lemon juice. \r\n\r\nCook for 2-3 minutes, stirring until all the flavors meld. It is important so that the lemon juice melds with the other ingredients first, otherwise you may experience curdling. Lower the heat, add heavy cream and simmer for 5-10 minutes being careful not to overcook the chicken livers. I usually test one by cutting it open and it should still be just slightly pink in the middle. Pour brandy into the pan, sprinkle with parsley and serve with crusty bread."
